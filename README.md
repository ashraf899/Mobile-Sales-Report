## Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into mobile sales data. The dashboard helps users identify trends, track sales performance, and derive actionable insights to support business decisions.

## ETL Process
1. **Data Import**: Imported raw sales data from an Excel file.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Merged and split columns.
   - Removed unnecessary rows and replaced specific values.
   - Changed data types for consistency and analysis readiness.
3. **Data Modeling**:
   - Established one-to-many and many-to-one relationships to ensure accurate data connections.

## Key Features
- **Visuals Created**:
  - Column, bar, line, area, funnel, and map charts.
  - Table and pie charts for detailed breakdowns.
- **Filters and Interactions**:
  - Used drop-down slicers to filter data by mobile brand, model, payment method, and month.
  - Configured visual interactions using the *Edit Interaction* tool.
- **User Experience Enhancements**:
  - Added cards displaying key metrics: total sales, total quantity, transactions, and average price.
  - Incorporated a page navigator for seamless navigation between dashboard pages.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**

## DAX Measures
Developed custom measures to enhance the analysis, including:
- **SUM()**: Aggregate total sales from the online store.
- **SUMX()**: Iterate and sum over a table to calculate sales performance.
- **COUNTROWS()**: Count the number of transactions in the sales data.
- **AVERAGE()**: Calculate the average order value.
- **TOTALMTD()**: Calculate the month-to-date total sales.
- **SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()**: Compare current sales metrics with the same period in the previous year.
- **CALCULATE()**: Apply filters to modify the context of calculations for deeper insights.
- Created a **custom calendar table** for time-based analysis of sales trends.
